### Starting your studies ###

####  Orientation unit  ####

An orientation unit will take place at the beginning of your studies. In this unit, you will receive all of the information that is important as you start your degree course, the semester groups will be assigned, and you will be registered for the computer network. It is therefore very important that you attend.

The orientation unit will take place from

 **06.10.2025 until 09.10.2025**

You can find the details on the [orientation unit pages.](https://oe.informatik.haw-hamburg.de/)

####  Preparatory mathematics course  ####

Strong math skills are critical to successful studies in Information and Electrical Engineering. For this reason, the Department of Information and Electrical Engineering offers new students the opportunity to test and refresh their knowledge in a preparatory course.

**The course will take place from 17.9. - 2.10.2025.**

**Please either show up in BT7 building or contact the Tutors for more detailed information:** mathevorkurs-ti-ie(at)haw-hamburg(dot)de

### Elective Project 1 - CJ1 (Bachelor's project) ###

####  Elective project CJ1 (template)  ####

The CJ1 elective project is intended to give students the opportunity to work on a topic of their choosing in a team of four. Students gain experience in the application of project management methods to complex technical problems and further develop their ability to work within a team.

[Application for a CJ1 elective project](/fileadmin/TI-IE/PDF/Studium/Studienorganisation/Pr%C3%BCfungsangelegenheiten/Bachelorprojekt/Antrag_Bachelorprojekt_IE_Application_for_a_Compulsory_Project_CJ1.pdf)

### Master’s options in the Department of Information and Electrical Engineering ###

####  Master’s options for Information Engineering students (B.Sc.)  ####

Are you already studying in a Bachelor’s degree course in the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science and interested in one of these three Master’s courses: Automation Technology (M.Sc.), Information and Communication Technology (M.Sc.), or Microelectronic Systems (M.Sc.)?

[Here you can find an overview of the entry possibilities](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/index.php?id=5530&L=1) for Bachelor’s graduates, as well as our academic advisors’ recommendations for a successful transition and what you should keep in mind during your Bachelor’s studies to prepare.

### Forms ###

####  Study-related forms  ####

* Application to change enrolment in elective subjects/projects/social sciences courses
* Application to participate in a compulsory elective module from another course of study

####  Examination-related forms  ####

* Application for a credit and grade confirmation
* Request for oral examination and minutes (in accordance with APSO-INGI)
* [Authorisation to collect certificate documents](/fileadmin/Studium/Pr%C3%BCfungsamt/FSB/Vollmacht_zur_Abholung_von_Zeugnisdokumenten.pdf)
* [Medical illness certificate (for presentation to the Examinations Committee)](/fileadmin/Studium/Pruefungsamt/Campus_Berliner_Tor/AerztlichesAttest.pdf)

If you have a health impairment, you may be able to apply for compensation for disadvantages (*Nachteilsausgleich*) in examinations. You can obtain more information from the representative for students with disabilities or chronic illnesses.

####  Regulations for exams missed due to illness  ####

In the event of illness, you must submit a **sick note from your doctor (*Krankmeldung*)** to the Faculty Service Office immediately – i.e. within the three days following the examination. If a sick note is not received by the Faculty Service Office in time, you will be required to submit a **medical certificate (*ärztliches Attest*)**. To ensure that a conclusive and specific certificate is submitted, the Examinations Committee will provide you with a form to give to your doctor (see above under 'Examination-related forms'). Please ensure that the certificate is filled out correctly, and especially that it contains the practice stamp and the doctor's signature.

In general, the decision about whether an illness is a valid justification for not attending an examination will be made by the Examinations Committee.

In the event that an examination must be interrupted due to illness, special conditions apply. More information can be obtained from the Examinations Committee.

In the case of a supplementary oral examination, an oral examination, or a colloquium, the examiner must be informed that the examination cannot take place due to illness.
